You must have Python 3 installed (at least version 3.1).

edit first line of pydf to point to your python interpreter,
copy pydf somewhere into your path, 
copy pydf.1 where your manpages reside (e.g. /usr/local/man/man1)
and copy pydfrc into /etc/pydfrc, or ~/.pydfrc

Modify /etc/pydfrc according to your taste.
